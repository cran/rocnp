Description: A set of tools for working with Romanian personal numeric codes. 
    The core is a validation function which applies several verification
    criteria to assess the validity of numeric codes. This is accompanied by 
    functionality for extracting the different components of a personal numeric
    code. A personal numeric code is issued to all Romanian residents either at 
    birth or when they obtain a residence permit.
